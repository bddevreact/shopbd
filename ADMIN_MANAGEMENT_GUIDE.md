3. **Organize logically** by product type or effects

### Product Management
1. **Use consistent naming** with symbols (★) for visual appeal
2. **Include relevant details** in descriptions
3. **Set appropriate prices** based on market rates
4. **Use detailed products** with quantities for premium items

### Security
1. **Keep admin user list minimal**
2. **Regularly backup data**
3. **Monitor admin activities**
4. **Use strong user IDs**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Access denied" error:**
- Check if your user ID is in admin_config.json
- Verify user ID is correct (numbers only)
- Restart bot after adding admin user

**Changes not saving:**
- Check file permissions
- Ensure admin_categories.json is writable
- Use /reload command to refresh data

**Product not appearing:**
- Check if category is active
- Verify product is active
- Use /reload command

### Error Messages
- **"No categories available"**: Create a category first
- **"Category not found"**: Check category name spelling
